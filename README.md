# Movie Filter App

This is a simple React application that displays a list of movies and allows the user to filter them by genre. The app includes three main components: `App`, `MovieList`, and `GenreFilter`.

## Features

- Displays a table of movies with their titles, genres, and release years.
- Allows the user to filter movies by genre using genre filter buttons.
- Filters the movie list based on the selected genre.
- Logs the selected genre to the console when a genre button is clicked.

## Project Components

1. **App**: The root component that renders the entire app, including the `MovieList` and `GenreFilter` components.
2. **MovieList**: A component that displays a table with the list of movies, showing each movieâ€™s title, genre, and year.
3. **GenreFilter**: A component that renders genre filter buttons. When a button is clicked, it logs the selected genre to the console and updates the displayed movie list based on the selected genre.
